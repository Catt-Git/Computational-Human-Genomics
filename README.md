# Computational-Human-Genomics
Hi! If you are a QCB student, good luck with the exam! If you need any help, feel free to reach out. You can use this code pipeline as a reference to check whether youâ€™ve completed everything that was requested. Just make sure to first read the CHG_Assignment_24_25.pdf on the GitHub page to see if the professors have updated any requirements.
Note: The final results of my project were not the best. Based on my experience, here are two suggestions:
1.	Avoid adding supplementary material.
2.	Take a look at the GitHub pages of my colleagues whose projects were more appreciated by the professors.
Thanks for visiting my GitHub page!
